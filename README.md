# Web-Scraper
## Web scraper (made using Python in VSCode) using the Selenium framework

## Motivation:
I wanted to build a webscraper to create my own datasets from scratch.
It is a framework to be used for collecting different kinds of data including:

1. housing data in London and around England
2. product pricing from Ebay, Amazon
3. data related to what people watch from Netflix and Youtube
4. Sentiment analysis for google trends and youtube trends
